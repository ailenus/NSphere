# $n$-Sphere

An $n$-sphere is a topological space in the $(n + 1)$-dimensional normed
Euclidean vector space defined as
$$S^n(r) = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : \lVert x \rVert = r\}$$
wherein $r$ is the radius thereof.

This project demonstrates object-oriented design principes using examples of
different classes of $n$-spheres. Object-oriented design principles are
sometimse summarised in the mnemonic &lsquo;APIE&rsquo;&#8212;abstraction,
polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation.
